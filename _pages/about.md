Hey Everyone, I'm Akhilender Jeet Singh Bana.

Welcome to my personal website! I'm from Haryana, India, and I work in the Solar PV manufacturing industry, specializing in advanced thin film deposition techniques such as Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD), Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD), and Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD). Beyond my professional life, I have a deep passion for continuous learning and sharing knowledge. 

I am an avid note-taker and reader, always eager to delve into new topics and expand my understanding. My aim is to make detailed notes on everything I learn and share these insights with a broader audience. I believe that if I find something useful, thereâ€™s a good chance others will too.

Join me on this journey as I document my learning experiences and share them with the world. Whether youâ€™re a fellow enthusiast, a student, or just curious, I hope my notes and reflections will inspire and assist you in your own quest for knowledge.
