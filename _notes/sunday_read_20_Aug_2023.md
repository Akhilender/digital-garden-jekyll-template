# Dickens Process 
*Source: Tools of the Titans by Tim Ferriss*

The Dickens process refers to self-limiting believes you hold in three times zones (past, present, and future). Tim Ferriss describes these believes as follows (taken verbatim): 

> - *What has each each belief cost you in the past, and what has it cost people you've loved in the past? What have you lost because of this belief? See it, hear it, feel it.*
<!-- That I can ignore my role as an older brother to guide my younger siblings. As a result my siblins are a bit confused about their career. I used to think that they can do it on their own. But that's not true.
That I don't need savings. Something would work out. I will manage somehow.  -->
> 
> - *What is each costing you and people you care about in the present? See it, hear it, feel it.* 
<!-- That my back will recover on its own.  -->
>
> - *What will each cost you and people you care about 1, 3, 5, and 10 years from now? See it, hear it, and feel it.*
<!--  -->
**Why do I find it fascinating?**: The above prompts force you to revisit your past, live in your present, and imagine the future considering your internal process. Each of the above helps in a critical anaylysis of decisions that you have taken in your past, are in process of taking or will take.

# "FOLLOW YOUR PASSION" is a Terrible Advice 

*Source: Tools of the Titans by Tim Ferriss (Guest: WILL MacASKILL)*

One of the most heard phrase in movies and often seen people giving advice is 'follow your passion'. It feels great to hear it, but quite ardous to follow it. The problem is that most of the people (including me) don't know their passion and due to which often feel lost, followed by simply ignoring it. Its not an easy task to discover your passion. It takes serious mental effort to ask questions such as what profession you like or think can make serious impact in the society. It may lead to more thought provoking questions such as "why you like it or think its important?". The answer to this "why?" might take several hours, days, weeks or even months. But, I think its still worthy because the outcome can make you proactive about things other than your profession. The so called, "Socratic Thinking", can wideopen various loosely closed doors or our own life. I had the same feeling during the covid lockdown....

In the words (taken verbatim) of "Will MacAskill", 
 > *The biggest predictor of job satisfaction is mentally engaging work. Its not got that much to do with you... It's whether the job provides a lot of variety, gives you good feedback, allows you to exercise autonomy, contributes to the wider world -- Is it actually meaningfull? Is it making the world better? - and also, whether it allows you to exercise a skill that you've developed.*

### When asked about "Advice to your 20-year-old-self?"
> You have 80,000 working hours in your life. It's incredibly important to work out how best to spend them, and what you're doing at the moment.

Will: "Let's say you're going out for dinner and it's going to take a couple of hours. You spend 5 minutes working out where to go for dinner. It seems reasonable to spend 5% of your time on how to spend the remaining 95%. If you did that with your career, that would be 4,000 hours, or 2 working years. I think, it's a pretty legitimate thing to do - spending that length of time trying to work out how should you be spending the rest of your life."
